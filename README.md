## 🕒 Time & Interaction Metrics
- [ ] **Time per Item**: Analyze the average time spent on each item.
- [ ] **Number of Interactions per Item**: Count and visualize interactions per item.
- [ ] **Overall Time per Session**: Compute and visualize total session durations.

## 🔍 Navigation & Engagement Patterns
- [ ] **Patterns of Navigation**: Identify common user navigation paths.
- [ ] **Popularity of Items & Exhibitions**: Determine the most visited items and exhibitions.
- [ ] **Interest in Themes**: Analyze interaction time per exhibition to infer user interest.
- [ ] **Use of Visual Layers**: Track usage of layers (1944, 1945, 1944 aerial, memorial site 2014).
- [ ] **Ratio of Exploration vs. Exhibition Engagement**: Calculate time spent exploring vs. engaging with content.
- [ ] **Alternative Content Engagement**: Look at alternative events when content is unavailable (e.g., content closed or visit finished).

## 🎯 Visitor Segmentation & Engagement
- [ ] **Threshold for New Visitors/Groups**: Define session segmentation based on inactivity (~1-2 min).
- [ ] **Items per Session & Keyword Analysis**: Extract keywords from session items.
  - [ ] Generate word clouds per session.
